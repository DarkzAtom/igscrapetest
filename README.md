#Instagram Selenium Reels Scraper with IP Rotation
Instagram reels' href Selenium Python scraper. Don't be scared that the final number of scraped reels differs from the initially provided number by the Instagram on the top of the page: scraper collects only unique hrefs in the set, some of the reels are repeating themselves and not all of them are represented on the page from the start. 
With that, we can extrapolate and continue the task of the scraper to scrape the internal data of each particular reel, etc, whatever to your liking. It is just the start basis. 
The main feature of that is you can scrape the data with this scraper with almost no chance of getting banned thanks to the use of IP rotation via proxies (Smartproxy service is used in this case to be precise, Zyte and its Smart Proxy Manager was previously used). However, if you use a single account (as it's shown in the video, the scraper is capable of logging in before scraping to get more results from the page to scrape) you'll have the probability of getting caught by Meta. So the solution is to use the database of accounts with a rotating algorithm or just use it without authorisation (which, on the contrary, is legal).
